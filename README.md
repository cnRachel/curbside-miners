# curbside-miners
One's trash is another's treasure. 💰💍👑

Curb mining is the act of salvaging appliances, electronics, furniture and art discarded on the street. 🛣 By uploading images of items you find by the curbside, you can reduce the damange done to the items from the weather, and potentially prevent them from ending up in the landfill.💜

Help your community and environment by sharing these discarded commodities on Curbside Miners!
